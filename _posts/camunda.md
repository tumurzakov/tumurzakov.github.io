One of my most long-playing projects is integration of Camunda engine to corporate ifrastructure.
It is promissing technology to rise business processes to new level.
Most problems in enterprise domain rises on information transition between employees.
Some task could be done by one person and wait in the task list of another for few days or even weeks before second person will have time to work out it.
Such inefficient lengthens process overall. If tasks could be done immediately things runs much faster.

I read story abount one management case in IBM.
There was department that took customers complains and made it in conveyer maner.
First employee took task, process his part of work and send it to another which acts same way while all work will be done.
After each step task just lays down in incoming box waiting the time when will be taken by next person in the chain.
Processing of single complain could take several weeks and it was very annoying for customers.
Decision was to process all complain by one person from beginning to the end.
After that change processing time of one task magically decreases from several weeks to several hours just because of eleminating of time gaps on transferring between employees.

Camunda is smart task engine that works with BPMN diagrams and could track execution of process.
There are wonderfull tools for controlling execution flow of the tasks between multiple participants:
* Gates that could decide in which direction execution will come
* System tasks that could make background calculations
* Subprocesses that helps decompose complex tasks into a number of simple steps
