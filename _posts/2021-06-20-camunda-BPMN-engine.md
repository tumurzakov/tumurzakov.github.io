One of my most long-playing projects is integration of Camunda engine to corporate ifrastructure.
It is promissing technology to rise business processes to a new level.
Most problems in enterprise domain rises on information transition between employees.
Some task could be done by one person and wait in the task list of another for few days or even weeks before second person will have time to work out it.
Such inefficient lengthens process overall. If tasks could be done immediately things will run much faster.

I read story about one management case in IBM.
There was department that took customers complains and resolve them it in conveyer maner.
First employee took task, process his part of the work and sent it to another which acted same way while all work will be done.
After each step task just waited in incoming box when will be taken by next person in the chain.
Processing of single complain could take several weeks and it was very annoying for customers.
Decision was to process all complain by one person from beginning to the end.
After that change processing time of one task magically decreases from several weeks to several hours just because of eleminating the time gaps on transferring between employees.

Camunda is smart task engine that works with BPMN diagrams and could track execution of process.
There are wonderfull tools for controlling execution flow of the tasks between multiple participants:
* Gates that could decide in which direction execution will come
* System tasks that could make background calculations
* Subprocesses that helps decompose complex tasks into a number of simple steps

Other words Camunda is the ideal tool for tasks orchestration in big enterpise company.
Ofcourse this maner of task exeution is only fits for already stable processes such as manufacture or customer support.
It could seem that it is step to taylorism but it is not.
Camunda gives enough flexibility to change processes to adaptate them to reality.
It is just comfortable tool for keeping information of some process in one place.
